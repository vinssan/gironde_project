		<h2> What is your task during the stage 2? </h2>


		<h3> The order you set is very important </h3>
		<p> The first element of your list (when you wrote "1") will be displayed with certainty during stage 3</p>
		<p> The second element of your list (when you wrote "2") is less likely to be displayed during stage 3 </p>
		<p> The third element of your list (when you wrote "3") is even less likely to be displayed during stage 3 </p>
		<p> The fourth element of your list (when you wrote "4") is even less likely to be displayed during stage 3 </p>

		
			
		<p> Please note that even if the fourth element is less likely to be displayed than the third element, it is still possible that <br/>
		the fourth element will be displayed and not the third element <br/>
		 The same is effective for the second element.</p>
