		<h1> INSTRUCTIONS - STAGE 2 (8/10) </h1>

		<h2> What is your task during the stage 2? </h2>


		<p> Of course, because one of the two lotteries during stage 3 come from stage 2, you would like to know the amounts hidden behind "a€", "b€", "c€" and "d€" </p>
		<p> You offer you to tell us what amount you consider to be the most important to you</p>
		<p> Actually, you must order hierarchically the hidden informations from the most important to the less important according to you </p>

		<p> 
			To do that, aside each hidden information you can write "1", "2", "3" or "4".<br/>
			By writting "1" you say that this information is the most important for you.<br/>
			By writting "2" you say that this information is less important.<br/>
			By writting "3" you say that this information is even less important. <br/>
			By writting "4" you say that this information is even less important. <br/>
		</p>


			
		<p> Note that there is no good or bad answers </p>
